Implement the design from provided PSD file accurately. Feel free to use any tools you like. Please send us a link to the repository of your solution after you're finished - we're as much interested in the source code as in the working application.

Don't worry about cross-browser compatibility, or mobile views support. Focus on code quality and maintainability.
